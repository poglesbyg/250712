# Frontend Architecture

## Component Structure

The frontend is organized into a modular component hierarchy focused on laboratory management:

/lims-ui/src/components/
- Dashboard.tsx - Main laboratory workspace interface
- ui/ - Core lab-specific UI components including:
  - alert.tsx - Sample status notifications
  - badge.tsx - Sample/batch identifiers
  - card.tsx - Test result displays
  - progress.tsx - Analysis progress tracking
  - select.tsx - Sample/test selection
  - tabs.tsx - Lab workflow organization

## State Management

Core domain states managed include:
- Active sample tracking
- Test result processing status
- Analysis workflow progress
- Lab technician authentication
- Equipment integration status

## UI Patterns

Laboratory-specific patterns implemented:
- Test result cards with status indicators
- Sample batch grouping interfaces
- Analysis workflow step indicators
- Equipment integration status displays
- Result validation checkpoints

## Business Logic Components

Key domain components:
1. Sample Management Interface (Importance: 85)
- Sample metadata display
- Batch organization
- Chain of custody tracking

2. Analysis Dashboard (Importance: 90)
- Real-time test progress monitoring
- Result visualization
- Quality control checkpoints

3. Equipment Integration Panel (Importance: 80)
- Device connection status
- Data synchronization interface
- Calibration monitoring
