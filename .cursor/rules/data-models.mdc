# data-models

## Core Data Entities

### Sample Management
- Sample tracking and batch organization
- Lab result storage and analysis flags
- Integration points with AI analysis results

### Laboratory Operations
- Equipment and instrument tracking
- Test procedures and methodologies
- Result validation workflows

## Database Schema

PostgreSQL implementation focusing on:
- Sample lifecycle management
- Batch processing workflows
- Analysis results storage
- AI model predictions and flags

## Entity Relationships

### Primary Relationships
1. Sample → Batch associations
2. Results → Analysis mappings
3. Equipment → Test procedure links

### Integration Points
- AI analysis results linked to samples
- Test procedures connected to equipment
- Validation workflows tied to results

## Important Scores

- Sample Management Model: 95 (Core business entity)
- Lab Operations Schema: 90 (Critical operational data)
- Analysis Results Model: 85 (Key integration point)
- Equipment Tracking: 75 (Important workflow support)
- Validation Rules: 70 (Supporting business logic)
