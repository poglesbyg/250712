## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)

A modular platform integrating laboratory operations with AI-driven analysis capabilities through three core components:

### Core Laboratory Services (Importance: 95)
- Sample and batch tracking management
- Laboratory workflow orchestration
- Integration with existing laboratory systems
- Secure data persistence layer

### AI Analysis Engine (Importance: 90)
- Automated anomaly detection in lab results
- Intelligent sample analysis
- Data-driven insights generation
- Machine learning model inference

### Web Dashboard Interface (Importance: 85)
- Real-time laboratory data visualization
- Sample tracking and management
- Analysis results presentation
- Workflow management interface

## System Architecture

### Microservice Components
1. `/lims-core/` - Rust-based laboratory management services
2. `/lims-ai/` - Python AI analysis engine
3. `/lims-ui/` - TypeScript/React laboratory interface

### Data Organization
- Centralized PostgreSQL database
- Containerized deployment structure
- Microservice communication protocols

## Core Business Workflows

### Laboratory Management (Importance: 95)
- Sample lifecycle tracking
- Batch processing coordination
- Results validation and verification
- Quality control monitoring

### AI-Powered Analysis (Importance: 90)
